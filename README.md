The MultiLanguage Invoice Extractor is a sophisticated tool designed to leverage the capabilities of generative AI to accurately extract key information from invoices across different languages. 
This project aims to simplify the process of data extraction from invoices, making it accessible and efficient for businesses that handle multi-language documents. The application supports various file formats including 
JPG, JPEG, and PNG, and can handle file sizes up to 200MB. Users can input specific prompts, such as "Total amount," to extract the relevant information from the uploaded invoice image.

This application is built with a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily upload invoice images and specify the data they want to extract. The backend employs advanced machine learning models to interpret 
and process the text from the images, ensuring high accuracy and efficiency. The system is designed to be robust, handling different invoice formats and languages seamlessly. The extracted data is displayed clearly, 
providing users with the exact information they need without the hassle of manual data entry.

To use the MultiLanguage Invoice Extractor, ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed. Clone the repository from GitHub and run the application locally. Upload your invoice image through the interface, 
enter the prompt for the data you wish to extract, and let the AI handle the rest. The results will be displayed on the screen, making it easy for you to review and use the extracted data. This tool is ideal for 
businesses looking to streamline their invoicing processes and reduce the time spent on manual data extraction.
